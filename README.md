# Enigma

This repository is a game for educational purposes. 

It is designed to go along with a game where students have to guess words and serves a page where they have to input those.

A score is computed that takes into account the time it took to complete the game.

This is a simple, stupid implementation with little effort given to avoid cheating and was developed quickly to help a teacher.

Don't judge me based on this project :)

The page is hosted on Free-tier GitHub pages at: https://quilicicf.github.io/Enigma/
